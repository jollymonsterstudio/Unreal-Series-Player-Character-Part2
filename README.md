# Unreal C++ Tutorial 
### Player Character Series – Punch – Part 2 - Collisions

Hey guys,

This is the starter project for the second part of our Player Character series. 

The topics we are going to cover in this tutorial are:
* collisions and how to create them using UBoxComponents
* sockets and how to attach our colliders to our mesh
* UAnimNotifyState notifications that fire when our animations are triggered

You can find the associated video tutorial here: TBD

The master branch of this project is the starter while part2-end is the fininished lesson.

Hope this helps, Thanks.
